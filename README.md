# Stars Coding Challenge 4: Vegetation Health on the Gila River

In 2004, the Akimel O’otham and Tohono O’odham tribes won a water rights settlement in the US Supreme Court. Using satellite imagery, we can see the effects of irrigation water on the local vegetation.

You can find demo videos, further reading, and solution code online in the [ESIIL Learning Portal Stars Textbook](https://cu-esiil-edu.github.io/esiil-learning-portal/notebooks/05-vegetation/vegetation-stars.html)

## Getting started using GitHub Codespaces

To get started from the main repository page:
  1. Click on the green `Code` dropdown in the upper right
  2. Open the `Codespaces` tab
  3. Click `Create codespace on main`

It can take a few minutes for the codespace to load for the first time. Be patient! It doesn't make it go faster to try again. You can find out more about all your codespaces at https://www.github.com/codespaces. If you are using this repository through GitHub Classroom, you shouldn't run out of codespace minutes, but you can run out of storage space if you have too many codespaces open or download too much data.

## Challenge overview

There are 3 parts to this coding challenge:

  1. Complete the analysis notebooks in this repository with the sample data
  2. Complete the download notebook in this repository to practice accessing data
  3. Write a portfolio post:
     
       a. Come up with your own scientific question you can answer or explore with similar data
       b. Create a new notebook in this repository
       b. Reproduce the analysis to help answer your question
       c. Write a portfolio post explaining your results
       d. Upload the post to your data science portfolio webpage to show off your work!

Do your best to finish all three parts of the coding challenge by the end of the summer. We're here to help! And so are your professors and fellow students.
